# Data_warehouse_project 

- **Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytical Project repository.
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry-based practices in the data engineering and analytics.** 
---
- the first thing is we needd to create a project plan
- for creating a project plan we will use Notion
- Notion will help you to organise your plans, ideas all-in-one place.
- For creating a successful project, we need to have a clear project plan.
- Right now, I am at the beginning phase of my project. So, I am using the Notion tool for creating a basic project plan for my project.
- By using the Notion, we will create the main phases and stages of the project.

  # What we’re going to do in this project are
  **project requirement** Building the data warehouse (data engineering).
 - **Objective** The objective of the project is to develop a modern data warehouse using SQL serevr to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reports and informed decision making.
## What are the **specifications** of the project?
1. **Data sources** - Import data from the source systems, ERP and CRM provided  as CSV file.
2. **Data quality** - Cleans and resolves data quality issues prior to analysis.
3. **Integration** - Combine both sources into a single user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
4. **Scope** - Focus on the latest dataset only (historic data). Authorization of the data is not required.
5. **Documentation** - Provide a clean documentation model to support both businesses and stakeholders' analytical requirements.

- The component of your architecture must not be duplicated. So, we cannot have two parts doing the same thing.
- The idea here is not to mix the two parts. 
- if you are a good data architect you should never combine diffrent layers of

- keep SOC  [sepration of concerns] -> A good data architect follows this concept

 - right now all the conatiner are empty so we need to add content in these containers
 - What are different types of source systems which are connected to a data structure architecture?

* This way, we had made in the data architecture clear that what are the sources of the data.
- Designed the sources of the High level Architecture

- Next thing we're going to do is design what will be the content of the bronze, silver, and gold layers.

# General Principles 
# Defining Naming Conventions
* Set of Rules Or Guidelines for naming anything in the project
  - Database
  - Schema
  - Tables
  - Store Procedures
* For this project we gonna use nnake_case naming convension
---

---
# General Principles

- Naming Conventions: Use snake_case, with lowercase letters and underscores (_) to separate words.
- Language: Use English for all names.
- Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use SQL reserved words as object names.



# Table Naming Conventions

## Bronze Rules

All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.

- <sourcesystem>_<entity>
  - <sourcesystem>: Name of the source system (e.g., crm, erp).
  - <entity>: Exact table name from the source system.

  Example: crm_customer_info → Customer information from the CRM system.



## Silver Rules

All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.

- <sourcesystem>_<entity>
  - <sourcesystem>: Name of the source system (e.g., crm, erp).
  - <entity>: Exact table name from the source system.

  Example: crm_customer_info → Customer information from the CRM system.



## Gold Rules

All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.

- <category>_<entity>
  - <category>: Describes the role of the table, such as dim (dimension) or fact (fact table).
  - <entity>: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (e.g., customers, products, sales).

  Examples:
  - dim_customers → Dimension table for customer data.
  - fact_sales → Fact table containing sales transactions.



# Glossary of Category Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning           | Example(s)                      |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| dim_    | Dimension table   | dim_customer, dim_product       |
| fact_   | Fact table        | fact_sales                      |
| agg_    | Aggregated table  | agg_customers, agg_sales_monthly |



# Column Naming Conventions

## Surrogate Keys

All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix _key.

- <table_name>_key
  - <table_name>: Refers to the name of the table or entity the key belongs to.
  - _key: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.

  Example: customer_key → Surrogate key in the dim_customers table.



## Technical Columns

All technical columns must start with the prefix dwh_, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column’s purpose.

- dwh_<column_name>
  - dwh: Prefix exclusively for system-generated metadata.
  - <column_name>: Descriptive name indicating the column’s purpose.

  Example: dwh_load_date → System-generated column used to store the date when the record was loaded.



# Stored Procedure

All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern:

- load_<layer>
  - <layer>: Represents the layer being loaded, such as bronze, silver, or gold.

  Examples:
  - load_bronze → Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze layer.
  - load_silver → Stored procedure for loading data into the Silver layer.

## Project Initialization
* Create Database & Schemas

---

# Now start with Bronze layer
- Step 1: Analyse the source system
- understand the source system
- After understanding the source system start coding [Data ingestion]
- Data validation -> data Completeness and schema check -> is data is placed to its right position or not
- last step is documentation of our work

---
## Build source Systems 
- Analyse Source Systems
---
  <img width="763" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e022eb6-8e4d-4b20-8923-0c77644a118c" />

---
- started Building Bronge layer
- Create DDL for Tables
-  here are some specification of bronze layer
 
---
  <img width="405" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0cb92d1-48ac-4e93-bcfc-e3caeab9a614" />
    
---
- DDl -> Data Defination languages define the  structure of database yables
---
- now we are wrinting SQL  queries so that we can connect source system to our source system

 * We write SQL queries to integrate data from the source system into SQL Server.

If the source data is in an Excel or CSV file (e.g., customer details), we create a table in SQL Server that matches the structure of the file: same columns, correct data types, and a suitable table name.

Once the table is created, we can load/import the data into SQL Server without errors.
---
- created data base and shemas of all the tree layers
<img width="1235" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f65ac2fe-38cf-4964-a816-841e751f921f" />

 ---
 - Create SQL DDL script for all CSV files.

/*

============================================
Create database and schemas
============================================

Script purpose:
This script creates a new database named 'dataWarehouse' after checking if it already exists.
If the database exists, it drops and recreated. Additionally, the script sets up the three schemas
within the database: bronze, silver, and gold.

Warning:
Running this script will drop the entire data warehouse database if it exists. 
All data in the database will permanently be deleted. Proceed with caution 
and ensure you have proper backups before running this script

# Develop SQL load script
- and the method used for loading the data from source file to data base is **bulk insert**
