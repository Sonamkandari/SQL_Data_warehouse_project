# Data_warehouse_project

- the first thing is we needd to create a project plan
- for creating a project plan we will use Notion
- Notion will help you to organise your plans, ideas all-in-one place.
- For creating a successful project, we need to have a clear project plan.
- Right now, I am at the beginning phase of my project. So, I am using the Notion tool for creating a basic project plan for my project.
- By using the Notion, we will create the main phases and stages of the project.

  # What we’re going to do in this project are
  **project requirement** Building the data warehouse (data engineering).
 - **Objective** The objective of the project is to develop a modern data warehouse using My SQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reports and informed decision making.
## What are the specifications of the project?
1. **Data sources** - Import data from the source systems, ERP and CRM provided  as CSV file.
2. **Data quality** - Cleans and resolves data quality issues prior to analysis.
3. **Integration** - Combine both sources into a single user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
4. **Scope** - Focus on the latest dataset only (historic data). Authorization of the data is not required.
5. **Documentation** - Provide a clean documentation model to support both businesses and stakeholders' analytical requirements.

- The component of your architecture must not be duplicated. So, we cannot have two parts doing the same thing.
- The idea here is not to mix the two parts. 
- if you are a good data architect you should never combine diffrent layers of

- keep SOC  [sepration of concerns] -> A good data architect follows this concept

 - right now all the conatiner are empty so we need to add content in these containers
 - What are different types of source systems which are connected to a data structure architecture?

* This way, we had made in the data architecture clear that what are the sources of the data.
- Designed the sources of the High level Architecture

- Next thing we're going to do is design what will be the content of the bronze, silver, and gold layers.
